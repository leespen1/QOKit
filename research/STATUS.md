# Research status

*Last updated: 2026-06-10 (evening). This is the one page Spencer needs to read.
Everything here links to a reproducible experiment or a committed document.*

**Goal:** QCE 2027 contributed paper, *"When and why does the homogeneous proxy work?
QAOA parameter setting as subspace compression."* Complete draft by **Aug 15, 2026**;
arXiv late August; submit April 2027. Full plan: see `research/decisions.md` and the
program plan (Claude's plan file, to be mirrored into `research/program.md`).

## Where we are

**Phase 0 complete (one day, ahead of schedule); Phase 1 (go/no-go gate, target
~Jul 8) underway** — E1.1 done, E1.2/E1.3 next.

## What we know (established results only)

- **The homogeneous proxy is exactly an orthogonal subspace compression of QAOA**
  (not an approximation): running the proxy with the same-instance empirical
  N(c';d,c) equals evolve-one-layer-then-project-onto-cost-classes, to machine
  precision. → [experiments/001_proxy-is-compression](experiments/001_proxy-is-compression/README.md)
  Consequence: total proxy error splits cleanly into *compression error*
  (leakage out of the cost-class subspace, model-independent) + *model error*
  (using analytical/fitted N instead of the instance's own).
- **Parameter setting is well-posed, and the compression itself is nearly lossless
  at p=1 on every graph family** (ER, BA, WS, 3-regular; n=12–14, 420 instances):
  value-added over the balanced-partition baseline is positive for every single
  instance, and the exact-compression proxy lands within ~0.03 AR of the true grid
  ceiling on all families. Regret grows to ~0.06–0.09 at p=3 ramps.
  → [experiments/002_baselines-and-headroom](experiments/002_baselines-and-headroom/README.md)
  Two consequences: (i) the old log's "proxies fail on non-ER graphs" must be a
  *model-error* story (bad analytical N), not a compression-error story, at least
  at p=1 — sharpens what E1.3 must separate; (ii) depth, not graph family, is
  where compression error first bites.

## Working hypotheses (NOT established — from the deleted research log or intuition)

- H1: The proxy's usefulness is governed by leakage out of the cost-class subspace,
  which concentrates only for ER-like graphs. (The paper's central claim.)
- H2: Fitted proxy shapes (triangle/Gaussian) with lower entrywise MSE against the
  empirical N(c';d,c) gave *worse* parameter setting. (Old log; needs re-verification.)
- H3: Sampling 5–10 bitstrings per cost class suffices to estimate the quantities that
  matter. (Old log; needs re-verification in the leakage metric, not entrywise N.)
- ~~H4: On ER(0.5), random balanced partitions reach ~75–85% approximation ratio.~~
  **Confirmed** (exp 002: 0.75–0.76 mean on ER(0.5) and BA(k=4) at n=12–14); folded
  into metric design as "value-added" = AR_proxy − AR_baseline.
- H2/H-ER-specific is now under pressure: exp 002 shows the *compression* is
  near-lossless on non-ER families at p=1, so any non-ER failure must come from the
  analytical/fitted N (model error). E1.3 tests this directly.

## Open questions / next experiments

- ~~E0.1: is the proxy numerically identical to the compressed evolution?~~ **Done, yes** (exp 001).
- ~~E1.1: is there headroom above baselines?~~ **Done, yes, on every family** (exp 002).
- E1.2 (next): does accumulated per-layer leakage tightly track the true-vs-proxy
  overlap deficit for p=20 ramps (Theorem-2 bound tightness)?
- E1.3 (gate, ~Jul 8): do leakage, fidelity, and regret rank graph families
  identically — and does swapping in the analytical PaperProxy N isolate model
  error from compression error? (Exp 002 predicts model error dominates at p=1.)
